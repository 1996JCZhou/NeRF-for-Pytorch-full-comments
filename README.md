# NeRF for Pytorch with full code comments

Welcome to my GitHub project dedicated to delving into the exciting world of [NeRF](http://www.matthewtancik.com/nerf) (Neural Radiance Fields), a cutting-edge technique that has revolutionized the synthesis of novel views for complex scenes. NeRF has emerged as a state-of-the-art method, pushing the boundaries of computer vision and enabling the generation of highly realistic and detailed images from sparse 2D viewpoints. To better comprehend this novel computer vision technology, I embarked on a journey of learning and exploration, starting with the study of the project available at https://github.com/yenchenlin/nerf-pytorch.

In this project, I have taken the initiative to meticulously annotate almost every line of code, striving to provide comprehensive explanations and insights into the intricacies of NeRF. The goal is to offer an in-depth understanding of this powerful methodology, enabling others to grasp its inner workings.

My journey into NeRF does not end here; this project is an ongoing endeavor. As the field of computer vision continues to evolve, we will keep exploring and experimenting with NeRF to further unlock its potential and refine its applications. Let's embark on this exciting adventure together and embrace the power of NeRF in pushing the boundaries of scene synthesis and computer vision!
